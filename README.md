# week-2-assignment Reflection

What requirements did you achieve?
I successfully met all user goal requirements. Additionally, I implemented keyboard accessibility, allowing users to navigate through images and select them using arrow keys and the enter or space key. I also developed media queries to ensure the design is responsive and adaptable to different screen sizes. One of my creative ideas was to make the photo gallery resemble a movie theatre screen. To achieve this, I used a grid layout that scales properly with the background image, creating a more immersive visual experience.

Were there any requirements or goals you were unable to achieve?
I wasnâ€™t able to complete two of the stretch goals: implementing srcset for responsive images and adding ARIA elements for improved accessibility. Much of my time was spent ensuring that the design worked seamlessly across all screen sizes.

Initially, I had a grand vision for the project. I wanted to add movie posters inside the theatre room, where clicking on a poster would load a different set of thumbnails to browse through. However, this idea proved to be too complex and time-consuming for the scope of the assignment. While it would have been a nice addition, I decided to focus on the core requirements instead.
